# act configuration — run GitHub Actions locally
# Docs: https://nektosact.com
#
# The release workflow targets windows-latest, which act cannot run natively.
# We map it to a Linux runner and accept minor shell differences (bash vs pwsh).
# Shell commands in the workflow use bash-compatible syntax for this reason.

# Map windows-latest → ubuntu runner image (medium size, has Node + common tools)
--platform windows-latest=catthehacker/ubuntu:act-22.04

# Store artifacts locally when using just ci-run
--artifact-server-path /tmp/act-artifacts

# Use the .github/act/ directory for event payloads
# (override per-run with: act push -e .github/act/push-tag-event.json)
